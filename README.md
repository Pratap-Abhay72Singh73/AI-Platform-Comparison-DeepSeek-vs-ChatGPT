# 🤖 DeepSeek vs ChatGPT-Churn and Retention Analysis.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project compares two popular AI platforms, **DeepSeek** and **ChatGPT**, across 15+ key performance indicators (KPIs). The aim was to analyze platform performance, user behavior, and satisfaction metrics to determine which AI tool performed better under various usage conditions.

## 📁 Files Included
- `AI_Comparison_Dashboard` – Excel dashboard with pivot tables, charts, KPIs, and slicers.
- `AI_Comparison_Analysis.sql` – SQL queries using CTEs and window functions for data transformation.
- `Screenshots/` – Visuals of dashboard and KPI charts.
- `DeepSeek_vs_ChatGPT_Dataset.csv` – Sample data used for simulation.

## 🧠 Key Metrics Analyzed
- Churn Rate  
- Session Duration  
- Response Accuracy  
- Platform Downtime  
- User Retention  
- Response Speed vs User Rating

## 🔍 Key Insights
- 📱 **DeepSeek users had 25% longer session durations** on mobile devices compared to ChatGPT.
- 📈 **Higher user retention** observed on DeepSeek during peak churn days.
- ❗ Identified a **moderate negative correlation (-0.46)** between response speed and user satisfaction — slower replies led to lower ratings across both platforms.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used
- **SQL:** Data aggregation, `CTE`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LEAD()`, and window functions  
- **Excel:** Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, KPI Cards  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Correlation coefficient for behavioral insight  
- **Storytelling:** Insight-based dashboards and comparisons

## 🚀 Business Impact (Simulated)
This project simulates how business intelligence teams can compare platform performance in SaaS products. The dashboard helps CX teams and product managers track satisfaction KPIs, reduce churn, and optimize AI response logic.
